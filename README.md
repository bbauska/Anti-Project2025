The loose relationship between science (facts) and politics in America.

Many conservatives have a loose relationship with facts. The right-wing denial of what most people 
think of as accepted reality starts with political issues: As recently as 2016, 45 percent of 
Republicans still believed that the Affordable Care Act included “death panels” (it doesn’t). 
A 2015 poll found that 54 percent of GOP primary voters believed then-President Obama to be a 
Muslim (…he isn’t).

Then there are the false beliefs about generally accepted science. Only 25 percent of 
self-proclaimed Trump voters agree that climate change is caused by human activities. Only 43 
percent of Republicans overall believe that humans have evolved over time.

And then it gets really crazy. Almost 1 in 6 Trump voters, while simultaneously viewing 
photographs of the crowds at the 2016 inauguration of Donald Trump and at the 2012 
inauguration of Barack Obama , insisted that the former were larger. Sixty-six percent of 
self-described “very conservative” Americans seriously believe that “Muslims are covertly 
implementing Sharia law in American courts.” Forty-six percent of Trump voters polled just 
after the 2016 election either thought that Hillary Clinton was connected to a child sex 
trafficking ring run out of the basement of a pizzeria in Washington, D.C., or weren’t 
sure if it was true.

If “truth” is judged on the basis of Enlightenment ideas of reason and more or less 
objective “evidence,” many of the substantive positions common on the right seem to 
border on delusional. The left is certainly not immune to credulity (most commonly 
about the safety of vaccines, GMO foods, and fracking), but the right seems to specialize 
in it. “Misinformation is currently predominantly a pathology of the right,” concluded 
a team of scholars from the Harvard Kennedy School and Northeastern University at a 
February 2017 conference. A BuzzFeed analysis found that three main hyperconservative 
Facebook pages were roughly twice as likely as three leading ultraliberal Facebook 
pages to publish fake or misleading information.

Why are conservatives so susceptible to misinformation? The right wing’s disregard 
for facts and reasoning is not a matter of stupidity or lack of education. 
College-educated Republicans are actually more likely than less-educated Republicans to 
have believed that Barack Obama was a Muslim and that “death panels” were part of the 
ACA. And for political conservatives, but not for liberals, greater knowledge of 
science and math is associated with a greater likelihood of dismissing what almost 
all scientists believe about the human causation of global warming.

It’s also not just misinformation gained from too many hours listening to Fox News, 
either, because correcting the falsehoods doesn’t change their opinions. For example, 
nine months following the release of President Obama’s long-form birth certificate, 
the percentage of Republicans who believed that he was not American-born was actually 
higher than before the release. Similarly, during the 2012 presidential campaign, 
Democrats corrected their previous overestimates of the unemployment rate after the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics released the actual data. Republicans’ overestimated even 
more than before.

Part of the problem is widespread suspicion of facts—any facts. Both mistrust of 
scientists and other “experts” and mistrust of the mass media that reports what 
scientists and experts believe have increased among conservatives (but not among 
liberals) since the early ’80s. The mistrust has in part, at least, been deliberately 
inculcated. The fossil fuel industry publicizes studies to confuse the climate change 
debate; Big Pharma hides unfavorable information on drug safety and efficacy; and many 
schools in conservative areas teach students that evolution is “just a theory.” The 
public is understandably confused about both the findings and methods of science. 
“Fake news” deliberately created for political or economic gain and Donald Trump’s 
claims that media sites that disagree with him are “fake news” add to the mistrust.

But, the gullibility of many on the right seems to have deeper roots even than this. 
That may be because at the most basic level, conservatives and liberals seem to hold 
different beliefs about what constitutes “truth.” Finding facts and pursuing evidence 
and trusting science is part of liberal ideology itself. For many conservatives, faith 
and intuition and trust in revealed truth appear as equally valid sources of truth.

To understand how these differences manifest and what we might do about them, it helps 
to understand how all humans reason and rationalize: In other words, let’s take a detour 
into psychology. Freud distinguished between “errors” on the one hand, “illusions” and 
“delusions” on the other. Errors, he argued, simply reflect lack of knowledge or poor 
logic; Aristotle’s belief that vermin form out of dung was an error. But illusions and 
delusions are based on conscious or unconscious wishes; Columbus’s belief that he had 
found a new route to the Indies was a delusion based on his wish that he had done so.

Although Freud is out of favor with many contemporary psychologists, modern cognitive 
psychology suggests that he was on the right track. The tenacity of many of the right’s 
beliefs in the face of evidence, rational arguments, and common sense suggest that these 
beliefs are not merely alternate interpretations of facts but are instead illusions rooted 
in unconscious wishes. 

This is a very human thing to do. As popular writers such as Daniel Kahneman, Cass Sunstein, 
and Richard Thaler have pointed out, we often use shortcuts when we reason, shortcuts that 
enable us to make decisions quickly and with little expenditure of mental energy. But they 
also often lead us astray—we underestimate the risks of events that unfold slowly and whose 
consequences are felt only over the long term (think global warming) and overestimate the 
likelihood of events that unfold rapidly and have immediate consequences (think terrorist 
attacks).

Our reasoning is also influenced (motivated, psychologists would say) by our emotions and 
instincts. This manifests in all kinds of ways: We need to maintain a positive self-image, 
to stave off anxiety and guilt, and to preserve social relationships. We also seek to 
maintain consistency in our beliefs, meaning that when people simultaneously hold two or 
more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values, one or the other must go. And so we pay more 
attention and give more credence to information and assertions that confirm what we already 
believe: Liberals enthusiastically recount even the most tenuous circumstantial evidence of 
Trump campaign collusion with the Russians, and dyed-in-the-wool Trump supporters happily 
believe that the crowd really was bigger at his candidate’s inauguration.

These limits to “objective” reasoning apply to everyone, of course—left and right. Why is 
it that conservatives have taken the lead in falling off the deep edge?

The answer, I think, lies in the interaction between reasoning processes and personality. 
It’s each person’s particular motivations and particular psychological makeup that affects 
how they search for information, what information they pay attention to, how they assess 
the accuracy and meaning of the information, what information they retain, and what 
conclusions they draw. But conservatives and liberals typically differ in their particular 
psychological makeups. And if you add up all of these particular differences, you get two 
groups that are systematically motivated to believe different things.

Psychologists have repeatedly reported that self-described conservatives tend to place a 
higher value than those to their left on deference to tradition and authority. They are 
more likely to value stability, conformity, and order, and have more difficulty tolerating 
novelty and ambiguity and uncertainty. They are more sensitive than liberals to information 
suggesting the possibility of danger than to information suggesting benefits. And they are 
more moralistic and more likely to repress unconscious drives towards unconventional sexuality.

Fairness and kindness place lower on the list of moral priorities for conservatives than 
for liberals. Conservatives show a stronger preference for higher status groups, are more 
accepting of inequality and injustice, and are less empathic (at least towards those 
outside their immediate family). As one Tea Party member told University of California 
sociologist Arlie Hochschild, “People think we are not good people if we don’t feel sorry 
for blacks and immigrants and Syrian refugees. But I am a good person and I don’t feel 
sorry for them.”

Baptist minister and former Republican congressman J.C. Watts put it succinctly. 
Campaigning for Sen. Rand Paul in Iowa in 2015 he observed, “The difference between 
Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans believe people are fundamentally bad, 
while Democrats see people as fundamentally good.”

These conservative traits lead directly to conservative views on many issues, just as 
liberal traits tend to lead to liberal views on many issues. But when you consider how 
these conservative traits and these conservative views interact with commonly shared 
patterns of motivated reasoning, it becomes clearer why conservatives may be more 
likely to run into errors in reasoning and into difficulty judging accurately what is 
true and what is false.

It’s not just that Trump is “their” president, so they want to defend him. Conservatives’ 
greater acceptance of hierarchy and trust in authority may lead to greater faith that what 
the president says must be true, even when the “facts” would seem to indicate otherwise. 
The New York Times cataloged no less than 117 clearly false statements proclaimed publicly 
by Trump in the first six months of his presidency, with no evident loss in his supporters’ 
faith in him. In the same way, greater faith in the legitimacy of the decisions of corporate 
CEOs may strengthen the tendency to deny evidence that there are any potential benefits from 
regulation of industry.

Similarly, greater valuation of stability, greater sensitivity to the possibility of danger, 
and greater difficulty tolerating difference and change lead to greater anxiety about social 
change and so support greater credulity with respect to lurid tales of the dangers posed by 
immigrants. And higher levels of repression and greater adherence to tradition and traditional 
sources of moral judgment increase the credibility of claims that gay marriage is a threat to 
the “traditional” family.

Conservatives are also less introspective, less attentive to their inner feelings, and less 
likely to override their “gut” reactions and engage in further reflection to find a correct 
answer. As a result, they may be more likely to rely on error-prone cognitive shortcuts, 
less aware of their own unconscious biases, and less likely to respond to factual corrections 
to previously held beliefs.

The differences in how conservatives and liberals process information are augmented by an 
asymmetry in group psychological processes. Yes, we all seek to keep our social environment 
stable and predictable. Beliefs that might threaten relationships with family, neighbors, 
and friends (e.g., for a fundamentalist evangelical to believe that humans are the result 
of Darwinian evolution or for a coal miner to believe that climate change is real and 
human-made) must be ignored or denied, at peril of disrupting the relationships. But 
among all Americans, the intensity of social networks has declined in recent years. 
Church attendance and union membership, participation in community organizations, and 
direct political involvement have flagged. Conservatives come disproportionately from 
rural areas and small towns, where social networks remain smaller, but denser and more 
homogeneous than in the big cities that liberals dominate. As a result, the opinions of 
family, friends, and community may be more potent in conservative hotbeds than in the more 
anonymous big cities where Democrats dominate.

The lack of shared reality between left and right in America today has contributed greatly 
to our current political polarization. Despite occasional left forays into reality denial, 
conservatives are far more likely to accept misinformation and outright lies. Deliberate 
campaigns of misinformation and conservative preferences for information that fits in with 
their pre-existing ideology provide only a partial explanation. Faulty reasoning and judgment, 
rooted in the interactions between modes of reasoning and judgment shared by all with the 
specific personality patterns found disproportionately among conservatives may also play a 
central role.
